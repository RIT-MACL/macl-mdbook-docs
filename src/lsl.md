TODO: figure out a good way to view streams

*Question 1*: What is a lab streaming layer (LSL).

A way to transmit, view, and interact with time-series scientific data.

*Question 2*: How does it work?

That is a complicated question there are many different ways that the LSL
can connect and work with. Examples include, USB, MATLAB, Audio Interface.
The idea of the design is to be modular and make it easy to code different
apps to work with the interface. The idea is that if a solution doesn't exist
for you can code an *LSL App* using the *liblsl API*.
